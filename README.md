# autosplitters

## Pizza Tower

Somewhat basic autosplitter that works off of the room number you're in. Curse you, Game Maker 2.
It will perform any time you go from a non-hub room to a hub room without discretion. This may result in false splits should you lose a boss fight or level and fail to restart before getting kicked out. The final split may also be slightly delayed.
